# Prime-Number-Finder
## Main Idea
The objective is to find lots of prime numbers really fast. This is done in c++.
## Testing
This has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04/18.04) and has been checked against others from the INTERNET.
## Compile command
    g++ main.cpp -std=c++11
### or
    make all

The main.cpp when exacuted produces a binary output file, and a plain text file.
